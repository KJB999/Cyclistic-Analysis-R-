# CONCLUSION  
Casual riders typically ride for longer times than Divvy's members, although the members have a much more steady ride usage while also contributing to more rides taken as well in contrast to the casuals. There isn't enough relevant data to discern why this is, and would require deeper data collection via surveys or more personally identifiable information. However, a case could be made for this result in that the casuals are riding for more leisurely reasons, like sight seeing or quick trips, while the members are riding for more routine ventures, such as school or work commutes. 

The most popular time of the year for cyclistics users were the summer months, specifically June, July and honorary mention August. The less popular were the colder months, as the avg bike use dwindles off in both casuals and members from the autumn into the winter months, having the lowest amount of rides in Nov, Dec, and Jan, when it becomes obviously less advantageous to bike outside. 

The members tend to ride steady during M - F, provoking the idea that they are commuting within a typical work or school schedule, while  the casuals ride less during the week and ramp up on the weekends, specifically Saturday being the casuals most popular day to ride, Sunday being the second. 

The most popular end station for the **casual riders** is *Streeter Dr & Grand Ave*. Likewise, the most popular bike type for them is the **classic bike**, comparatively this is also the *members* favorite bike as well, as they use this bike more than the *casuals* raising potential for casuals missing out on that bike type dependent on timing. 

The conclusion in the analysis is that while both type of Cyclistic users prefer the warmer months to colder to use the service, the members ride more and steadier than the casuals while the casuals ride longer than the members throughout the year. Therefore, the marketing strategies provided below, should be implemented around May - early June to capitalize on the heightening rides into the summer, with an emphasis on weekend rides and top popular bikes and end stations like **Streeter Dr** and *classics*.




# RECCOMMENDATIONS 
To engage casual riders and convert them to members, the following strategies can be implemented:
1.) Introduce a rewards program that offers incentives to members who ride frequently and use popular bike types, like the classic bike.
2.) Offer promotions or discounts to casual riders who sign up for a membership during the summer months when bike usage is highest.
3.) Establish partnerships with local businesses or attractions near popular end stations to offer exclusive deals or discounts to members, encouraging them to ride to these locations.
